# Extra-tension-Y2K
A chrome extension that goes a little bit over the top in a WEB1.0 way. 
Think, the early days of mySpace, first blogs, glitter! 

What does it do? 
It transforms every website to their inner Paris Hilton form. 
Changing every image on the webpage with glitter, loving hearts, or rainbows.
Final touch: our favourite font for reading (if you have dyslexia): Comic Sans!
